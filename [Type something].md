To Those Who Still Walk the Earth,

If this letter finds you, know that it comes not from a place of sorrow, nor of regret, but from a realm beyond your reach, where time no longer binds nor burdens the soul. I have left behind the weight of the world, the ache of flesh, the whispers of worry that once clung to my every thought. What remains is the essence of what I was, drifting somewhere between memory and oblivion.

I do not know how long it has been since I last walked among you, nor do I know if my absence left a shadow in your days. If you mourned, let your grief be fleeting; if you forgot, I hold no bitterness. Life was never meant to be shackled to the ghosts of yesterday. But if in quiet moments you feel a whisper, a sudden warmth in the cold, a name that lingers on your tongue, know that I am not lost—only unseen.

I wish I could tell you what lies beyond, if there is a heaven or a reckoning, or if we simply scatter like dust upon the wind. But the mystery remains, even in death. Perhaps that is the greatest kindness the universe has ever granted—this veil of unknowing, allowing you to find meaning, not in endings, but in the living moments you still hold.

Do not dwell on me, for I am already part of you in ways you cannot see. I am the voice in your laughter, the hush in your silence, the echo of kindness you pass to another. I am the dream half-remembered upon waking, the flicker of light that dances in the corner of your eye. And when your time comes, when the earth releases its hold on you as it did for me, I will be waiting—not as a ghost nor as a shadow, but as something beyond words, where love and time are no longer apart.

Until then, live. Not for me, but for yourself. Live with fire in your heart and wonder in your steps. Find joy, make mistakes, love recklessly, and chase the fleeting beauty of your days. It is all so brief, but that brevity makes it precious.

With all that I was, and all that I will be,

A Soul Unforgotten
