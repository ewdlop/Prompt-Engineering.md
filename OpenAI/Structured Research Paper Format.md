# Structured Research Paper Format

```markdown
Got it! I will create a research paper format where the traditional 'Abstract' is replaced by an 'Extract' section. The 'Extract' will serve as a concise yet informative summary, highlighting key points, findings, and relevance in a structured manner. 

I’ll update you once the format is ready.

# Structured Research Paper Format (with **Extract** Section)

In a typical research article, the major sections include a Title, Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, and References ([Research Paper Structure](https://psychology.ucsd.edu/undergraduate-program/undergraduate-resources/academic-writing-resources/writing-research-papers/research-paper-structure.html#:~:text=A%20complete%20research%20paper%20in,2)). In this structured format, we replace the traditional **Abstract** with an **Extract** section. The **Extract** serves as a structured summary of the paper, highlighting the study’s key findings, significance, and conclusions in a concise, academic manner. It is similar to a *structured abstract* – an abstract divided into labeled parts (e.g., **Background**, **Methods**, **Results**, **Conclusions**) for quick comprehension ([Structured Abstracts](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/policy/structured_abstracts.html#:~:text=A%20structured%20abstract%20is%20an,see%20Figure%201)). Below is the outline of the research paper format with all essential components, maintaining a clear IMRaD-based flow (Introduction, Methodology, Results, and Discussion) and logical progression:

## Title and Author Information 
- **Title:** A clear, concise title that reflects the scope of the study.  
- **Authors and Affiliations:** Full names of all authors, along with their institutional affiliations. Include contact information (e.g. corresponding author’s email) if required.  
- *(Optional:* **Running Head** or short title for page headers, if the style guide requires it.*)*

## Extract (Structured Summary)  
A **brief, structured summary** of the research, replacing the abstract. It typically runs ~150–300 words and is divided into a few labeled sub-components for clarity. For example:  

- **Background/Purpose:** 1–2 sentences on the context of the research and the primary objective or research question.  
- **Methods:** 1–2 sentences summarizing the methodology – including the study design, data sources or participants, and analytical approach.  
- **Key Findings/Results:** 2–3 sentences highlighting the most important results or discoveries made in the study (with relevant data or trend indications, but kept concise).  
- **Conclusions/Significance:** 1–2 sentences stating the main conclusion and the significance or implications of the findings. (How do the results contribute to the field or address the research problem?)  

*This structured Extract allows readers to quickly grasp what was done, what was found, and why it matters, without reading the full paper. It functions similarly to a traditional abstract but with clear subheadings that emphasize each aspect of the study.* 

## Keywords  
A list of **keywords** or key phrases (typically 3–6 items) that are central to the research. These terms should capture important concepts from the study to aid indexing and searchability. *(Place the keywords directly after the Extract for easy reference.)*

## Introduction  
The **Introduction** establishes the context and rationale for the research. It generally moves from broad to specific, guiding the reader into the study’s topic. Key elements include:  

- **Background & Context:** Introduce the general area of research and any relevant background information. Explain the broader problem or phenomenon of interest, supported by references to past literature as needed.  
- **Problem Statement:** Clearly state the specific research problem, question, or hypothesis that the paper addresses. What gap in knowledge or unresolved issue prompted this study?  
- **Significance:** Explain why this research is important. Highlight how addressing this problem contributes to the field or solves a practical issue.  
- **Overview of Approach:** (Optional) Briefly summarize how the study was conducted or the approach taken to investigate the problem. Some introductions also include a short outline of the paper’s structure or a summary of major findings to provide a roadmap for the reader.

## Literature Review (or Background Theory)  
*(Note: This section may be part of the Introduction in some fields, but it is often separate in a thesis or comprehensive paper.)*  

- **Review of Prior Work:** Summarize relevant previous studies, theoretical frameworks, and findings related to your research question. This shows the current state of knowledge and establishes context.  
- **Identification of Gaps:** Critically analyze the literature to identify gaps, inconsistencies, or open questions that your research will address.  
- **Theoretical Framework:** If applicable, describe the theories or models underpinning your work. Define key terms or concepts.  
- **Research Objectives/Hypotheses:** Conclude the literature review by reiterating the specific objectives of the current study and, if relevant, stating the hypotheses to be tested (linking them to the gaps identified above).

## Methodology  
The **Methodology** (or Methods) section provides a detailed and transparent account of how the research was conducted, allowing others to understand and potentially replicate the study. It should be organized clearly (often with subheadings). Key components:  

- **Research Design:** Describe the overall design or type of study (e.g., experimental, survey, observational, qualitative case study, etc.). Include whether it’s exploratory, descriptive, causal, etc., as appropriate.  
- **Materials and Participants:** Detail the sample or data sources. For empirical studies, describe the participants (including selection criteria, sample size, relevant characteristics) or datasets used. Mention any instruments, apparatus, or materials employed (e.g., questionnaires, lab equipment).  
- **Procedure:** Explain the step-by-step procedure of the study. For experiments, outline each phase (e.g., randomization, interventions, measurements). For qualitative research, describe how data were gathered (interviews, observations, etc.).  
- **Data Analysis:** State how the data were processed and analyzed. For quantitative studies, mention statistical tests or software used. For qualitative studies, describe the coding or analytical strategy.  
- **Ethical Considerations:** (If applicable) Note any ethics approval, informed consent procedures, or other ethical safeguards that were followed during the research.  

*The methodology should be detailed enough that another researcher could replicate the study. Clarity and thoroughness here contribute to the paper’s credibility.* 

## Results  
In the **Results** section, present the findings of the study *objectively*, without interpretation or commentary (those go in the Discussion). Organize this section around the research questions or hypotheses. Key guidelines for this section:  

- **Report Key Findings:** Summarize what was discovered, referencing any tables or figures that display data. Include only results relevant to the research questions. (For example: statistical outcomes like means, p-values, confidence intervals; or themes in qualitative analysis.)  
- **Text, Tables, and Figures:** Present data in a clear form. Use text to highlight and summarize important trends or points from any tables/figures. Each table or figure should be labeled and referred to in the text, and it should have a descriptive caption.  
- **Sequence and Subsections:** If there are multiple experiments or distinct studies within the paper, break the Results into subsections for each. Otherwise, use a logical sequence (perhaps following the order of hypotheses or research questions).  
- **No Interpretation:** Refrain from discussing why results turned out a certain way – save that for the Discussion. The tone here should be factual and impartial, reporting the data as observed.  

## Discussion  
The **Discussion** section interprets and examines the results, explaining their meaning and significance in the context of the research question and existing literature. This section typically **flows from specific findings back out to the broader context**, completing the logical arc of the paper. Key elements include:  

- **Interpretation of Results:** Explain *what the results mean*. Do the findings support the hypothesis or answer the research question? Discuss how the results relate to expectations. If results were surprising or contrary to predictions, delve into reasons why.  
- **Contextualization:** Compare your findings with those of previous studies or theories discussed in the Literature Review. Are your results consistent with, extending, or contradicting earlier work? This shows how your study fits into or changes the scholarly conversation.  
- **Implications:** Discuss the significance of the findings. What do they contribute to the field of study or to practical applications? Explain how the results might influence theory, future research, or real-world practice/policy.  
- **Limitations:** Acknowledge the limitations of your study. Every research has some (e.g., sample size, methodological constraints, potential biases). Being transparent about these limitations helps temper conclusions and suggests caution in interpretation.  
- **Future Directions:** Based on the findings and limitations, suggest areas for further research. What unanswered questions remain? What would you investigate next, or what improvements could future studies make?  

Throughout the discussion, maintain an academic tone: focus on analysis rather than just restating results, and support claims with evidence or reasoning. This section allows you to **demonstrate scholarly insight by linking your work back to the bigger picture**.

## Conclusion  
The **Conclusion** is a brief final section that wraps up the paper, reinforcing the main points and leaving the reader with a clear understanding of the study’s outcome and importance. In a short article, the conclusion may be a paragraph at the end of the Discussion; in longer works, it can be a separate section. It should:  

- **Summarize the Main Findings:** Recap the core findings or arguments of the paper in a synthesized way, highlighting what the study has revealed or confirmed. (This is essentially the answer to the research question posed in the Introduction.)  
- **Address the Research Purpose:** Tie the results back to the objectives stated in the Introduction. State how the study fulfilled its purpose or answered the initial problem.  
- **Emphasize Significance:** Convey the broader implications or significance of the findings one more time. Why do these findings matter? This could be a take-home message about advancing knowledge or practical impact.  
- **Closing Statement:** Optionally, end with a concise concluding thought or a call to action. For example, you might suggest how the findings could be applied, or reiterate a recommendation for future inquiry or practice.  

*The conclusion should not introduce new data or arguments, but rather provide closure. It gives readers a sense of completion and understanding of the work as a whole.* 

## Acknowledgments *(optional)*  
In this section, you can **recognize any contributions or support** that were instrumental to the research but not part of the authorship. This may include:  

- Funding sources or grant agencies that supported the research.  
- Colleagues or mentors who provided significant advice or assistance.  
- Any contributors (e.g., research assistants, statisticians, proofreaders) who helped in non-authorship roles.  
- **Dedication or personal thanks** (if appropriate for the publication).  

Keep acknowledgments brief and professional. This section is usually placed after the main content and before the references.

## References  
A **complete list of all sources cited** in the paper, formatted according to the required style guide (APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.). Key points for this section:  

- Include every source that was cited in-text (and do not include items that were not cited).  
- Arrange the entries in the order prescribed by the style (usually alphabetical by author’s last name for APA/MLA).  
- Follow precise formatting rules for each entry (authors, year, title, publication, etc.) as required by the citation style.  
- If using a numbering style (like Vancouver or IEEE), ensure the reference list numbers match the citations in the text.  

The References section ensures **scholarly integrity**, giving credit to prior work and enabling readers to locate the sources you used. 

## Appendices *(optional)*  
Appendices contain supplementary material **that is relevant to the research but too detailed or tangential for the main text**. This might include:  

- **Raw data sets or sample calculations** that would clutter the results section but are provided for transparency.  
- **Technical details or instrument instructions** that are useful for replication but not critical to understanding the results (e.g., a full survey questionnaire, code snippets, or extensive tables).  
- **Additional figures or tables** that support the work (e.g., detailed experimental setups, background information).  

Each appendix should be labeled (Appendix A, Appendix B, etc.) and referred to at least once in the text for context. Appendices appear after the References.

**Flow and Clarity:** The above format ensures a logical flow common to scholarly work: beginning with broad context (Introduction), narrowing to specific methods and results, then broadening out again to implications (Discussion and Conclusion) ([Structuring the Research Paper: Formal Research Structure | UMGC](https://www.umgc.edu/current-students/learning-resources/writing-center/online-guide-to-writing/tutorial/chapter4/ch4-23#:~:text=For%20the%20formal%20academic%20research,methods%2C%20results%2C%20discussion%2C%20and%20conclusions%2Frecommendations)). The replacement of the Abstract with an **Extract** section provides a concise, **structured overview** for readers to quickly understand the essence of the research **at a glance**, by clearly delineating the purpose, methodology, key findings, and conclusions of the study. Each subsequent section of the paper then elaborates on these points in detail, following a clear progression. This structured approach helps maintain clarity and academic rigor, guiding the reader through the research in a coherent manner from start to finish.
