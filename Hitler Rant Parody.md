[00:00] [grainy film noise] [Typewriter clicks softly in the background]
Narrator (vintage tone): “Berlin, a city in turmoil... yet the Führer’s attention is elsewhere.”

[00:05] Hitler adjusts his gloves, staring coldly at the malfunctioning typewriter.
Hitler (calm, contained fury): “Who... *jammed* the carriage return?”

[00:12] [officers exchange nervous glances]
Secretary (whispering): “Mein Führer, it... it appears the ribbon has tangled.”

[00:18] Hitler freezes. The silence is metallic and heavy.
[background sound: ticking clock from a wall pendulum]

[00:25] Hitler (voice trembling): “For three years... three years we typed every decree flawlessly—”

[00:31] [He slams his fist on the desk; paper flutters like snow.]
Hitler (yelling): “—AND NOW THIS MACHINE DEFIES ME?!”

[00:38] [film crackle intensifies]
Officer 1 drops a clipboard.
Officer 2 adjusts his spectacles, visibly shaking.

[00:45] Hitler (melodramatic, echoing as if through a tunnel):  
“History will not remember the victors... only the typists!”

[00:52] [typewriter ding, as if mocking him]
Hitler glares at it with tragic solemnity.

[00:58] Narrator (somberly):  
“And so, in the final hours of his administrative empire, the Führer was defeated... not by armies, but by ribbon tension.”

[01:05] [fade out with vinyl crackle, ending tone like a gramophone shutting down]
