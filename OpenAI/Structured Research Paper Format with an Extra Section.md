#  Research Paper Format with an 'Extra' Section

## No recursion?

Got it! I will generate a research paper format that includes an 'Extra' section instead of an abstract. This section will allow for additional context, extended discussions, or any extra information beyond the usual abstract. I’ll let you know once the structured format is ready.

## Structured Research Paper Format with an 'Extra' Section

In this format, the traditional **Abstract** is replaced by an **"Extra"** section that provides additional context or discussion. The goal is to maintain academic rigor while offering space for extended background or supplementary content. Below is a well-organized template that includes all essential components of a research paper, adaptable to different fields of study. Each section’s purpose is explained, ensuring clarity and flexibility across disciplines.

## Title & Author Information 
This appears on the first page and identifies the work and authors. It includes: 

- **Title:** A concise, descriptive title of the research. It should reflect the main topic or finding. (Often centered on the page, in title case.)
- **Author(s) and Affiliation(s):** Name of each author followed by their institutional affiliations. (Includes department, university or organization, and sometimes contact information such as email.)
- *Optional:* **Author Note or Funding Information:** Any acknowledgments of funding sources or contributions can be noted here if required by the publication format.

**Key points:** The title page tells what the paper is called and who wrote it ([Research Paper Structure](https://psychology.ucsd.edu/undergraduate-program/undergraduate-resources/academic-writing-resources/writing-research-papers/research-paper-structure.html#:~:text=What%20is%20this%20paper%20called,assisted%20with%20the%20research%20project)). Ensure the title is specific and informative. Author details provide credibility and allow correspondence.

## "Extra" Section (Extended Background/Discussion) 
**Purpose:** In place of a standard abstract, the **Extra** section offers a space for extended overview, background, or other relevant material that would not fit in a brief abstract. Unlike a typical abstract – a one-paragraph summary of the entire study (~150–250 words) ([Research Paper Structure](https://psychology.ucsd.edu/undergraduate-program/undergraduate-resources/academic-writing-resources/writing-research-papers/research-paper-structure.html#:~:text=Abstract)) – this section can be longer and more detailed. It maintains academic tone and can include citations to literature or data for context.

**Contents:** This section is flexible but should remain relevant and focused. It may include: 

- **Extended Background:** Deeper contextual information or historical background related to the research problem (beyond what the Introduction typically provides).
- **Additional Discussions:** For example, an expanded discussion of the motivation or significance of the study, clarifying why the research matters in a broader context.
- **Supplementary Insights:** Any relevant insights, definitions of key terms, or preliminary notes that help the reader understand the work (which might otherwise be placed in footnotes or appendices). For instance, detailed explanations of theory or methodology rationale that are useful but not *critical* to the main narrative (content that might usually go in an appendix ([Research Paper Structure](https://psychology.ucsd.edu/undergraduate-program/undergraduate-resources/academic-writing-resources/writing-research-papers/research-paper-structure.html#:~:text=that%20is%20not%20critical%20to,often%20placed%20in%20an%20Appendix)) can be placed here for immediate accessibility). 
- **Extended Summary (Optional):** If desired, a longer summary of the research findings and implications, possibly with reference to supporting literature. This is like an “extended abstract,” giving readers a fuller overview than a traditional abstract would.

**Guidelines:** The Extra section should be clearly labeled (e.g., **Extra** or **Extended Introduction**), so readers know it is a special section. It should not simply duplicate the Introduction; instead, it complements it. Keep the content organized and coherent – use subheadings if necessary to structure this section. While it allows more freedom, ensure it remains scholarly (include references for any factual statements or literature mentioned). Readers should benefit from this section, but the paper should still be understandable even if one skips it (i.e., *essential* points should still appear in the Introduction or later sections).

## Introduction 
The introduction is the first section of the main text. It **establishes the research question and context** for the reader. In a standard paper, the introduction describes the topic and why it’s worth studying ([Research Paper Structure](https://psychology.ucsd.edu/undergraduate-program/undergraduate-resources/academic-writing-resources/writing-research-papers/research-paper-structure.html#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20topic%20and,in%20the%20sections%20to%20follow)). Key functions of the Introduction include:

- **Presenting the Research Problem:** Clearly state the problem, question, or hypothesis your study addresses. This often involves identifying a gap in current knowledge or an unresolved issue in the field.
- **Background (Brief):** Provide a concise overview of relevant background or prior research to contextualize the study. (This may include a brief literature context; a more extensive review can be in a separate section if needed.)
- **Objective and Scope:** State the aim of the research and what the paper will cover. Define the scope to let readers know the focus (and if necessary, what is outside the scope).
- **Significance:** Explain why this research is important. What contribution does it make to the field, or what practical/theoretical value does it have? This motivates the study.
- **Overview of Contents:** Optionally, in some fields, the introduction ends with a brief outline of the structure of the paper (to guide the reader through the upcoming sections).

*Academic rigor:* Even with an Extra section available for more detailed background, the introduction should remain clear and informative. It should *hook* the reader’s interest and logically lead to your methods. Typically, introductions summarize relevant prior work and highlight unresolved issues that the current research will tackle ([Research Paper Structure](https://psychology.ucsd.edu/undergraduate-program/undergraduate-resources/academic-writing-resources/writing-research-papers/research-paper-structure.html#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20topic%20and,in%20the%20sections%20to%20follow)). By the end of the introduction, the reader should understand what the study is about and what to expect in the following sections.

## Literature Review or Background (if applicable) 
In many research papers (especially in social sciences, humanities, or as required by the field), a **Literature Review** or extended **Background** section is included, either as part of the introduction or as its own section. This section **surveys existing knowledge and theories** relevant to the research:

- **Scope of Review:** Discuss prior studies, models, or theories related to your research question. This shows the current state of knowledge.
- **Critical Analysis:** Highlight findings, strengths, and weaknesses of past work. Identify inconsistencies or gaps in the literature that your research will address.
- **Framework Building:** If your study relies on a theoretical framework or specific conceptual background, explain it here. Define key terms and concepts from the literature that are important for your study.
- **Relation to Current Study:** Conclude the literature review by summarizing how the reviewed literature leads to your research questions/hypothesis. Emphasize how your work will build upon or differ from existing studies.

**Placement:** This can be a standalone section (commonly titled **Literature Review**, **Related Work**, or **Background**) or integrated into the Introduction, depending on disciplinary norms. In fields like humanities, much of the "literature review" is often woven into an extended introduction or even spread throughout the analysis. In STEM fields, a concise literature review is sometimes part of the introduction or a separate section after it. The Extra section can also supplement this by providing additional background that is not critical for the main narrative.

## Methodology (Materials and Methods or Approach) 
This section explains **how the research was conducted** in sufficient detail. It should be thorough enough that another researcher could understand or even replicate the study ([Research Paper Structure](https://psychology.ucsd.edu/undergraduate-program/undergraduate-resources/academic-writing-resources/writing-research-papers/research-paper-structure.html#:~:text=involved%2C%20the%20study%20design%2C%20the,researcher%20to%20duplicate%20your%20research)). The name of the section may vary by field (e.g., *Materials and Methods* in experimental sciences, *Methodology* in social sciences, or *Approach* in theoretical work), but the core purpose is the same. Include:

- **Design/Approach:** Describe the overall design of the study or the approach taken. For empirical studies, state whether it’s experimental, observational, qualitative, quantitative, etc. For theoretical work, explain the analytical or logical approach.
- **Materials/Data Sources:** If applicable, describe the materials, instruments, or datasets used. (e.g., laboratory equipment, surveys or questionnaires, archival data, simulation tools, texts analyzed.)
- **Procedure:** Provide a step-by-step account of what was done. In an experiment, how were participants selected and what protocol was followed? In a data analysis, how were data collected and processed? In a theoretical paper, what logical steps or framework is used to address the problem?
- **Analysis Methods:** Describe how you analyzed the data or evidence. For quantitative studies, specify statistical tests or models. For qualitative, mention coding techniques or interpretive methods. For engineering/design, describe evaluation metrics or testing procedures.
- **Ethical Considerations:** If relevant (for studies involving human or animal subjects, for example), note any ethical approvals or considerations.

**Clarity and detail:** Write this section in a clear, methodical way. It often uses past tense and passive voice (e.g., “Data were collected by…”) in sciences. The key is to provide enough detail that the work is reproducible or that the reader trusts the rigor of your approach. If certain details or additional protocols are too lengthy, they can be summarized here and expanded either in the Extra section (if they are background to the method) or in an Appendix (if they are technical details). 

*Adaptability:* In fields without formal “methods” (like mathematical proofs or literary analysis), this section would describe the approach or theoretical framework. For example, in a math paper, one might outline the proof strategy or axioms, and in a literary analysis, one might explain the analytical lens or methodology (e.g., feminist critique, content analysis, etc.). The section should be tailored to whatever “how did you do this study” means for the discipline.

## Results (Findings) 
This section presents the **findings of the study** without interpretation (interpretation comes in the Discussion). It is often titled **Results** (especially in quantitative/experimental work) or **Findings** (in qualitative or humanities research). Depending on the nature of the study, this may include data, observations, textual analysis outcomes, etc. 

- **Report on Data/Observations:** State what you found, following the structure of the methods. For example, in an experiment, present results in the same order as the procedures or research questions. In a qualitative study, present themes or observations.
- **Use of Figures/Tables:** Present data in a clear form. Use tables, graphs, or images to summarize results if appropriate. Ensure each figure or table is labeled and referenced in the text (e.g., “Figure 1 shows…”). (In this format, figures/tables can be embedded in the text for readability, unless a specific style guide says otherwise.)
- **Textual or Thematic Results:** If the research is not data-centric (e.g., a philosophical argument or literature analysis), this section might be the core analysis or narrative of findings. For instance, present the argument’s supporting points or the outcomes of textual analysis in a structured way (maybe with subheadings for each theme or case).
- **No Interpretation Yet:** Refrain from discussing what the results *mean* in this section. Just present the facts or observations. Save interpretation for the Discussion (though minor commentary to help the reader understand a figure or result is fine).

**Organization:** If there are multiple parts to the results (e.g., multiple experiments or studies), consider sub-sections or grouping them logically (Experiment 1, Experiment 2, etc., each with its own results, as needed). This keeps the section organized and clear.

## Discussion 
The discussion section interprets and **analyzes the results**, explaining their significance in context. This is where you **answer the research question**, discuss implications, and relate findings back to the literature and theory. Key components of Discussion:

- **Interpretation of Results:** Explain what the results mean. Do they support your hypothesis or answer your research question? How do they solve the problem posed? This is the narrative that connects your findings to the bigger picture.
- **Relate to Existing Research:** Compare your findings with those from the literature. Are they consistent with, or different from, previous studies? Discuss why that might be. This shows how your work fits into or challenges existing knowledge.
- **Implications:** Discuss the significance of your findings. What do they contribute to the field? Are there practical implications, theoretical advancements, or new insights generated by the study?
- **Limitations:** Acknowledge any limitations of your study. No research is without constraints – discuss factors like sample size, methodological constraints, potential biases, or assumptions that may affect the results.
- **Future Work:** Suggest areas for further research or next steps. Based on your findings and limitations, what should future studies investigate? This shows that you understand the broader research trajectory.

The discussion is often the most narrative section and may be combined with results in some cases (especially if each result is immediately discussed in sequence). However, keeping them separate often helps maintain clarity. By the end of the Discussion, the reader should understand the **meaning and relevance** of your findings. In a rigorous paper, the discussion often revisits the initial hypotheses or questions and discusses whether they were answered, and how ([Research Paper Structure](https://psychology.ucsd.edu/undergraduate-program/undergraduate-resources/academic-writing-resources/writing-research-papers/research-paper-structure.html#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20significance%20of,research%20are%20also%20commonly%20addressed)) (including addressing unexpected findings). **Including limitations and future directions adds credibility** ([Research Paper Structure](https://psychology.ucsd.edu/undergraduate-program/undergraduate-resources/academic-writing-resources/writing-research-papers/research-paper-structure.html#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20significance%20of,research%20are%20also%20commonly%20addressed)), demonstrating critical reflection on the work.

## Conclusion 
The conclusion **wraps up the paper** by briefly summarizing the main findings or arguments and emphasizing their importance. It should give the reader a clear take-home message. In a concise way, do the following:

- **Summarize the Answer:** Recap how the research question was answered or what was discovered (or, in argumentative papers, what was demonstrated). This should be a high-level summary, not introducing new results.
- **Highlight Significance:** Reinforce why the outcomes are important. For example, remind the reader of the contribution to the field, any advancement of knowledge, or practical impact.
- **Closing Thoughts:** End with a strong final statement. This could be a recommendation, a broader implication (how it relates to a bigger issue or future vision), or a thought-provoking insight that stems from the study.
- *Avoid new information:* Do not introduce new data or arguments in the conclusion. It should only synthesize and reflect on what has already been presented.

The conclusion should be succinct. In some cases, it might be merged with the Discussion (as "Discussion and Conclusion") if appropriate, but often it stands alone for clarity. It gives a sense of completion to the narrative of the paper.

## Acknowledgments (optional) 
In this section, you can **thank those who assisted** in the research. This includes: 

- **Funding sources:** Acknowledge any grants or financial support.
- **Contributors:** Thank individuals who are not authors but helped (e.g., research assistants, technicians, colleagues who provided feedback, or participants if a survey).
- **Institutional support:** If applicable, mention any lab, department, or organization support.
- **Permissions:** If any content required permission (like images or data), acknowledge the source here.

Acknowledgments are typically placed after the main content (after Conclusion) and before the References. This section is usually brief. *Note:* In some fields or journals, acknowledgments might be part of the first footnote or on the title page (as an Author Note), but most commonly it's at the end of the paper. This section is optional but recommended if others contributed significantly or funded the work.

## References 
A complete list of all scholarly works **cited in the paper** is provided in the References section (also called **Bibliography** or **Works Cited**, depending on style). This section is crucial for academic integrity and allows readers to locate the sources used. Key points for the References section:

- **Complete Citations:** Every in-text citation must have a full reference entry. Include all necessary details (author(s), year, title of work, publication venue, volume/issue, pages, DOI or URL if applicable) in the correct format (APA, MLA, Chicago, etc., as required).
- **Consistent Style:** Follow a consistent citation style throughout. For example, APA style has specific guidelines for listing authors, titles, and publication info ([Research Paper Structure](https://psychology.ucsd.edu/undergraduate-program/undergraduate-resources/academic-writing-resources/writing-research-papers/research-paper-structure.html#:~:text=List%20of%20articles%20and%20any,Style%20page%20of%20this%20website)). Make sure the format (italics, punctuation) is uniform.
- **Order:** Typically, references are listed alphabetically by the last name of the first author (or by title if no author). In numeric citation styles, they might be listed in order of appearance.
- **Sufficient Information:** Ensure each reference is detailed enough for a reader to find the source. For articles, include journal name and volume; for books, include publisher; for websites, include the access date if needed, etc.
- **Uncited Works:** Do not include literature that was not cited in the paper (unless a specific format like a bibliography or further reading section is allowed – usually, stick to cited works only).

The References section demonstrates the scholarly foundation of your work. By carefully citing sources, you show academic rigor and allow verification of your information. This section is always required in research writing. 

## Appendices or Supplementary Material (optional) 
If you have **additional content that is too lengthy or detailed** for the main body but is useful for readers, include it in Appendices at the end of the paper. Appendices (labeled **Appendix A**, **Appendix B**, etc., if more than one) can contain material such as:

- **Raw Data or Calculations:** Large tables of data, detailed mathematical derivations, or extensive statistical results.
- **Extended Methodological Details:** For example, an expanded description of a survey instrument, code listings, or details of a secondary analysis that would interrupt the flow in the Methods section. (Often, technical programming code or exhaustive lists of stimuli are put here ([Research Paper Structure](https://psychology.ucsd.edu/undergraduate-program/undergraduate-resources/academic-writing-resources/writing-research-papers/research-paper-structure.html#:~:text=that%20is%20not%20critical%20to,often%20placed%20in%20an%20Appendix)).)
- **Supplementary Figures or Tables:** Any additional figures, graphs, or images that are supportive but not critical to understanding the main results. For instance, example images, extended charts, or additional case study details.
- **Questionnaires or Documents:** Copies of questionnaires, interview protocols, or other instruments used for data collection.
- **Additional Discussion:** In some cases, authors include an appendix for further discussion on a specific point (e.g. a detailed literature review segment or an explanation of a secondary theory) if it doesn't fit in the Extra section or main text.

Each appendix should be referred to in the main text at the appropriate point (e.g., “see Appendix A for the full questionnaire”). Appendices appear after the references in most formats. They should be titled and organized for easy navigation. They help keep the main text focused and concise, while still providing transparency and depth for those interested.

**Relation to "Extra":** It’s worth noting the distinction between the Extra section and Appendices. The Extra section is at the front and intended for readers to get supplementary insight upfront, whereas appendices are at the end for reference. You might use one or the other (or both) depending on the content. For example, broad context or discussion might go in Extra, while very technical details or raw data go in an Appendix.

## Adaptability to Different Fields of Study 
This structured format is designed to be flexible across disciplines. Different fields may adjust the section naming or emphasis, but the core components remain:

- **Sciences (Natural and Social):** Typically follow the IMRaD structure (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion) ([Structuring the Research Paper: Formal Research Structure - UMGC](https://www.umgc.edu/current-students/learning-resources/writing-center/online-guide-to-writing/tutorial/chapter4/ch4-23#:~:text=The%20pattern%20includes%20the%20following%3A,papers%20flow%20from%20the)). The Extra section would allow a longer background or a detailed abstract-like overview, which could be useful for interdisciplinary studies where additional explanation is needed. For example, a biology paper could use Extra to elaborate on a theoretical framework or extensive background on a technique, while the rest follows IMRaD.
- **Engineering & Computer Science:** May include a **Design/Implementation** section in place of or alongside Methods (to describe system or algorithm development). They might also have a **Results and Discussion** combined section. The Extra section could be used to discuss industry context or extended technical background (e.g., an overview of existing technologies) beyond the scope of the introduction.
- **Humanities:** Research papers in fields like literature, history, or philosophy might not have a separate Results section; instead, they present analysis and discussion in a continuous narrative. In this case, you might organize the main body into thematic sections rather than Methods/Results. The Extra section can be helpful for providing historical context, theoretical background, or an extended rationale before the main analysis. The rest of the format (introduction, conclusion, references, etc.) still applies, but the middle sections are adjusted to the discipline’s needs (for instance, **Methodology** might describe the theoretical approach or archives consulted, and **Findings** might be replaced with **Analysis** or **Argument**).
- **Interdisciplinary Research:** When combining methods from different fields, the Extra section is especially handy. It can explain interdisciplinary terminology or frameworks at the outset. The paper might have multiple methodology sections or result sections (as in multi-part studies). This format can accommodate that by allowing subheadings under Methods or Results for each aspect. The key is to maintain clarity by grouping related content.
- **Theses/Long Reports:** In longer works (like a thesis or dissertation), you often have multiple chapters (literature review, methodology, etc.). The Extra section concept can be used as a **Preface** or **Executive Summary** that provides extended insight at the beginning. All other components would then unfold in detail in subsequent chapters.

**Overall,** the structure outlined above includes all necessary components of rigorous research writing while introducing the **Extra** section for flexibility. By clearly defining each part of the paper and its role, this format ensures that the document remains organized and scholarly. Writers can adapt section titles and contents as appropriate for their field (for example, using *Analysis* instead of *Results* if no experimental results are present, or combining sections when needed), but all the fundamental elements—context, methodology, evidence, discussion, and documentation of sources—are preserved.

This format allows authors to provide a richer context from the start (via the Extra section) without sacrificing the clarity of the traditional research paper structure. Each section builds logically on the previous one, guiding the reader from background and motivation through the research process to the conclusions, all while accommodating additional discussions or background that enhance understanding. 

**Sources:**

- Typical research paper sections (Title, Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, References) are standard in academic writing ([Research Paper Structure](https://psychology.ucsd.edu/undergraduate-program/undergraduate-resources/academic-writing-resources/writing-research-papers/research-paper-structure.html#:~:text=A%20complete%20research%20paper%20in,2)). Abstracts are usually brief summaries (~150-250 words) ([Research Paper Structure](https://psychology.ucsd.edu/undergraduate-program/undergraduate-resources/academic-writing-resources/writing-research-papers/research-paper-structure.html#:~:text=Abstract)), but here we use an extended "Extra" section instead.  
- Introductions commonly set up the research problem, survey relevant literature, and identify the gap to be addressed ([Research Paper Structure](https://psychology.ucsd.edu/undergraduate-program/undergraduate-resources/academic-writing-resources/writing-research-papers/research-paper-structure.html#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20topic%20and,in%20the%20sections%20to%20follow)).  
- Discussions interpret results, often including limitations and future research directions ([Research Paper Structure](https://psychology.ucsd.edu/undergraduate-program/undergraduate-resources/academic-writing-resources/writing-research-papers/research-paper-structure.html#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20significance%20of,research%20are%20also%20commonly%20addressed)) to contextualize findings.  
- Content not critical to the main text is traditionally placed in Appendices ([Research Paper Structure](https://psychology.ucsd.edu/undergraduate-program/undergraduate-resources/academic-writing-resources/writing-research-papers/research-paper-structure.html#:~:text=that%20is%20not%20critical%20to,often%20placed%20in%20an%20Appendix)); in this format, some of that content can be presented up-front in the Extra section for convenience.  
- The IMRaD format (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion) is a well-known structure across many scientific fields ([Structuring the Research Paper: Formal Research Structure - UMGC](https://www.umgc.edu/current-students/learning-resources/writing-center/online-guide-to-writing/tutorial/chapter4/ch4-23#:~:text=The%20pattern%20includes%20the%20following%3A,papers%20flow%20from%20the)), and our outlined format is built on it, with modifications to suit various disciplines.
