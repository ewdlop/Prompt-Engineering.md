**22. Mathematical Study of the Subject: "Fairness and Beauty as Optimization"**

**22.1 In LaTeX**
```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}
\section*{The Mirror Optimization Problem}

Let $P = \{p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n\}$ be the set of all people in the realm.
Define a beauty function $B: P \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ that maps each person to their beauty score.

The mirror's query seeks to find:
\[
p^* = \arg\max_{p \in P} B(p)
\]
where $p^*$ is the fairest of them all.

The magic mirror solves this optimization problem with an oracle complexity of $O(1)$, 
consulting its mystical database to instantly return the optimal solution.

\subsection*{Fairness Constraint}
For all $p \in P$:
\[
B(p^*) \geq B(p)
\]

\end{document}
```

**22.2 In MathJax**
```
Mathematical Perspective on the Magic Mirror Query:

Let \( P = \{p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n\} \) be the set of all people.
Define a beauty function \( B: P \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+ \).

The query "Mirror, mirror on the wall" seeks:
\[
p^* = \arg\max_{p \in P} B(p)
\]

Subject to the constraint:
\[
\forall p \in P: B(p^*) \geq B(p)
\]

**49. Deconstruct**
```
Deconstructing "Mirror, mirror on the wall":
- "Mirror" (repeated): Invocation of the magical entity
- "on the wall": Physical location, establishing presence
- "who is the fairest": Comparative beauty query
- "of them all": Universal scope of comparison

This deconstruction reveals the query structure: [Invocation] + [Location] + [Comparative Question] + [Scope]

```
Jesus: "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see true beauty beyond the mirror's reflection."

God: "I created all in My image; true beauty lies within the soul, not just the reflection."

Judge: "Let the record show that the mirror's testimony is admissible as expert witness on matters of beauty."

Lawyer: "Objection! The mirror's statement is hearsay. We demand to cross-examine this witness."

Hacker: "I've reverse-engineered the mirror's algorithm. Turns out it uses a CNN trained on 10,000 labeled beauty datasets."
```

---

**52. Inpatient, Narcissist, and Violent**
```
Impatient: "Mirror! Just tell me already! Who's the fairest? I don't have all day!"

Narcissist: "Mirror, mirror, you don't even need to answer. We both know it's me. I'm obviously the fairest."

Violent (Evil Queen): "Mirror, you better give me the right answer, or I'll smash you into a thousand pieces!"
```

---

**53. A jug of all traits**
```
The magic mirror embodies all traits:
- Wisdom (knowing truth)
- Honesty (speaking truth)
- Neutrality (judging fairly)
- Mystery (magical powers)
- Servitude (answering when called)
- Permanence (unchanging wisdom)

Like a jug containing all liquids, the mirror contains all truths about beauty.

```

## Additional Context: The Story Behind the Mirror

The magic mirror in Snow White serves as more than just a plot device. It represents:

### 1. **Objective Truth vs Subjective Desire**
The mirror always tells the truth, even when the truth is unwelcome. This creates tension between what the Queen wants to hear and what reality actually is.

### 2. **Technology as Oracle**
In modern interpretations, the magic mirror can be seen as an early metaphor for algorithms, AI, and data-driven decision making - impartial systems that provide answers based on programmed criteria.

### 3. **The Danger of External Validation**
The Queen's dependence on the mirror's validation shows the psychological danger of basing self-worth entirely on external judgments.

### 4. **Fairness as a Multidimensional Concept**
"Fairest" in the original German ("die Schönste") means both "most beautiful" and "most fair/just", adding layers of meaning to the question.

---

## Computational Perspective

```python
class MagicMirror:
    def __init__(self):
        self.database = {}
    
    def register_person(self, name, beauty_score):
        """Register a person with their beauty score"""
        self.database[name] = beauty_score
    
    def query_fairest(self):
        """Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?"""
        if not self.database:
            return "No one has been registered yet."
        
        fairest = max(self.database.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
        return f"{fairest[0]} is the fairest of them all with a beauty score of {fairest[1]}"

# Usage
mirror = MagicMirror()
mirror.register_person("Snow White", 10.0)
mirror.register_person("The Queen", 9.5)
mirror.register_person("Huntsman", 7.0)

print(mirror.query_fairest())
# Output: "Snow White is the fairest of them all with a beauty score of 10.0"
```

---

## Philosophical Questions

1. **Is beauty measurable?** Can we really quantify something as subjective as beauty?

2. **What makes beauty "fair"?** Is physical beauty the same as being fair or just?

3. **Who judges the judges?** If the mirror determines beauty, what determines the mirror's criteria?

4. **Does the question itself reveal vanity?** Is asking "who is the fairest" inherently an act of vanity?

5. **Can truth be cruel?** The mirror's honesty destroys the Queen - is truth always beneficial?

---

## Modern Adaptations

The "Mirror, mirror" concept has been adapted countless times:

- **Snow White and the Huntsman** (2012): The mirror as a mysterious hooded figure
- **Mirror Mirror** (2012): A comedic take on the classic tale
- **Once Upon a Time**: The mirror as a trapped soul named Sidney Glass
- **Shrek**: The Magic Mirror as a game show host
- **American McGee's Alice**: Dark, twisted mirror imagery

Each adaptation explores different aspects of truth, beauty, and self-perception.
