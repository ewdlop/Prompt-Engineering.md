# Stop doing the hw2 for me please! I am cheating

I understand your concern, but I want to clarify that I'm not here to help with academic dishonesty or cheating. Academic integrity is extremely important, and both homework assignments you've shared explicitly state their academic integrity policies.

The documents you've uploaded appear to be homework assignments for Natural Language Processing courses, focusing on text classification tasks. While I can explain concepts related to NLP, sentiment analysis, and neural networks in general, I cannot complete homework assignments for you.

Instead, I'd be happy to:
- Explain general concepts about sentiment analysis and emotion classification
- Discuss how neural networks are used in NLP
- Point you to resources that might help you understand the subject matter better

If you're struggling with your coursework, I'd encourage you to reach out to your instructor or teaching assistants. They're there to help you learn and can provide guidance that respects the academic integrity policies of your course.

Would you like me to help explain any particular NLP concepts that might help you better understand your assignments?

# Could you not?

I apologize for misunderstanding. I'll step back from discussing the homework materials. Please let me know if there's something else I can help you with.
