# write a godel sentence in Gödel (programming language)

Here's a Gödel program that attempts to express a self-referential Gödel sentence, which states something akin to "This statement is unprovable in this system."

```godel
MODULE GodelSentence.

IMPORT List, Nat.

PREDICATE SelfReferential(G: Nat) -> Bool.

% Define a Gödel number G for this very statement.
SelfReferential(G) <-> Not(Provable(G)).

% Meta-theoretic assumption: If it's provable, it's true.
Provable(G) -> True(G).

% If it's true, then it's unprovable (Gödel’s Second Incompleteness Theorem).
True(G) -> Not(Provable(G)).

END GodelSentence.
```

### Explanation:
1. **SelfReferential(G) <-> Not(Provable(G))**  
   - This defines the self-referential nature of the Gödel sentence. It says that `G` is true if and only if it is not provable.

2. **Provable(G) -> True(G)**  
   - Assumes the formal system is sound: if something is provable, then it must be true.

3. **True(G) -> Not(Provable(G))**  
   - This expresses the core of Gödel's theorem: if the statement is true, it must not be provable.

Since the Gödel programming language is based on logic programming (similar to Prolog), this formalism captures the essence of Gödel's incompleteness theorem within the system.

Would you like me to refine it further or add more details?
